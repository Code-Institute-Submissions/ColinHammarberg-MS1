REFER DOCTOR

Refer Doctor is a tool for individuals to get a better overview of the current pandemic and is designed to make their lives a little bit easier. 


UX

Refer Doctor was created for every single individual who feels that the current system is not working well for them. There is a large number of individuals
who are affraid of the current infra structure, developed by the Official Swedish Health Department, due to the lack of structure and speed in the vacination process, 
but also the current risk with taking a Covid-19 test. To be able to take a Covid-19 test, to check if you either got antibodies against the virus or if your are currently 
infected by the virus, you will have to go and do it at a clinic. Refer Doctor has developed a delivery service for the Covid-19 tests, and have also developed a tool for 
individuals to check their current status of getting the vaccine against the virus.
