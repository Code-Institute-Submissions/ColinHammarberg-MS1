# REFER DOCTOR

##### Refer Doctor was created for every single individual who feels that the current system against the Covid-19 Virus is not working well for them.

# UX

* As an everyday user I want to experience User Friendly platforms, that are easy to understand. 
* The users of Refer Doctor are the individuals who wants a quick and safe process in the current pandemic.
* The users wants a tool to trust and a tool that respects and understands their needs. 
* Refer Doctor gives the users one single platform, to help them achieve a more safer, structual and quicker process in the current pandemic. 


##### Refer Doctor was created for every single individual who feels that the current system is not working well for them. There is a large number of individuals who are afraid of the current infrastructure, developed by the Official Swedish Health Department, due to the lack of structure and speed in the vaccination process, but also the current risk with taking a Covid-19 test. To be able to take a Covid-19 test, to check if you either got antibodies against the virus or if you are currently infected by the virus, you will have to go and do it at a clinic. Refer Doctor is developing a delivery service for the Covid-19 tests, and is also developing a tool for individuals to check their current status of getting the vaccine against the virus.

# Features

* The landing page shows the simplicity in the website. The landing page offers a menu selection and a button that will take the user to the page he or she wishes.
* The second section on the landing page describes the functionality of the website and shows the user what services that are offered. 
* The contact page gives the user the opportunity to contact the company with any questions the user may have. 
* The about us page exists to give the user a better understanding of what the company does and why it exists.
* The register page is where the user decides if he or she would like to use the company’s services. The user has to register before being able to use any of the external services offered by the company.

# Features Left to Implement

##### The user will not be able to access any of the services at this point. The service features will be implemented later on. The service feature mock-ups are visual among the other wireframe descriptions.

* The registration function has not been connected to an external storage server nor account management server.
* The contact function has not been connected with an external server.
* The Counseling page has not yet been published. 

##### At this moment Refer Doctor has only been developed with front end code and design. But will in the near future have all features functioning. 

# Technologies Used

### HTML
* The project uses HTML to get the content visual. The developer has been using HTML in all visual pages. 

### CSS 
* The project uses CSS to design all elements and sections that are visual on the site. The developer has been using External CSS, instead of Inline CSS, to achieve a more simplified code. The external CSS is implemented to all visual pages on the website. 

### FRAMEWORK
* The project uses BootStrap 4 to achieve a well functioning responsive website.   

### LANGUAGES
* The project uses English as its standard language and an Lang=”en” attribute has also been implemented. 

# Testing
### I (Colin Hammarberg) have been conducted tests for Refer Doctor regulary and have made sure that the website is functioning well. The website has been tested on the following devices:
* Macbook Air (13 Inch Screen Resolution)
* Ipad Pro (12.90 Inch Touch Screen Resolution)
* Iphone 12 (6.1 Inch Touch Screen Resolution)

#### I (Colin Hammarberg) believe that I have accomplished the UX goals I created. It's an easy platform to understand and it seems to be functioning well in the front end.

### This is how the site has been tested:

1. Landing page "Home"
* Pressing all of the menu selections, to make sure that all selections are connected to their corrent individual pages. 
* Pressing all buttons on the landing page (including the second section), to make sure that all buttons are connected to the right pages.
* Pressing the Title to make sure that it takes the user back to the landing page.
* Scaling the resolution downwards, to make sure that the entire page (including all sections) is responsive. 
* Pressing the social icons in the footer to make sure that they all lead the user to their individual external pages (Facebook, Twitter & Instagram).

2. About Us page 
* Pressing all of the menu selections, to make sure that all selections are connected to their corrent individual pages.
* Pressing the "Sign Up" button to make sure that it takes the user to the Sign Up/Register page.
* Pressing the Title to make sure that it takes the user back to the landing page.
* Scaling the resolution downwards, to make sure that the entire page is responsive and that the image disappear when the resolution is below (560px).
* Pressing the social icons in the footer to make sure that they all lead the user to their individual external pages (Facebook, Twitter & Instagram).

3. Contact Us page 
* Pressing all of the menu selections, to make sure that all selections are connected to their corrent individual pages.
* Pressing the Title to make sure that it takes the user back to the landing page.
* Typing in the requested details in the form and then pressing the "Send Inquiry" button to make sure that the message is sent. (This function does not work yet. Due to that no external storage server has been connected). This is applied in the "later features".
* Testing the checkbox to see if it responds.
* Scaling the resolution downwards, to make sure that the entire page is responsive and that the form responds as it should.

4. Register page
* Pressing all of the menu selections, to make sure that all selections are connected to their corrent individual pages.
* Pressing the Title to make sure that it takes the user back to the landing page.
* Typing in the requested details in the form and then pressing the button to make sure that it works accordingly. (This function does not work yet. Due to that no external storage server has been connected, nor any accounts management server/function/code). This is applied in the "later features".
* Testing the checkbox to see if it responds.
* Scaling the resolution downwards, to make sure that the entire page is responsive and that the form responds as it should.



# Deployment 
### The entire code was written in GitPod and then later on pushed into GitHub. The code was pushed and published very often, to ensure not losing any unsaved code and to avoid making mistakes with not saving the code accordingly. 

### To deploy and publish the written code onto the hosting website the developer has been using the GitPod Workspace branch by typing the following:

1. Git Status
2. Git add (include all unpublished pages and changes provided by “Git Status”)
3. Git commit -m “first commit”
4. Git push

# Credits
### I would like to give a lot of credit to my mentor Gurjot, who has been tutoring me alongside the project. I would also like to give credit to a very talented software developer named Erik Wibom. Erik has been giving me lessons, feedback and a better understanding of what it is I’m going to do. Thank you guys!
