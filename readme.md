Refer Doctor is a middleman tool inbetween the government and ordinary population 
of Sweden. It was created to increase the comfortbility for the ordinary person in a 
pandemic as Covid-19. 

I would like to send a special thank you to Erik Wibom for the help and tutoring 
for the landing page design. It turned out a lot better after I received the feedback notes 
and a 1to1 meeting with the talented software developer Erik Wibom.
